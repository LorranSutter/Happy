<!-- This project aims to create a web application and mobile web app to help people find places that contribute to **recycling**.

The web application is intended for the use of collection points, where is possible to:

- Register yourself as a collection point with name, email, whatsapp number, city, province/state, location, image and items that you collect.
- It is possible to upload and image of the place and user a interactive map to mark the place location.

The mobile web app is indended for users that want to find collection points, where is possible to:

- Find places by location and collected items.
- Browse for collection points using a map.
- Choose and read details about the collection point.
- Get in touch with the place, either registered email or whatsapp. -->

<!-- ## :runner: How to run

Open your terminal in the folder you want to clone the project

```sh
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/LorranSutter/Ecoleta.git

# Go to the project
cd Ecoleta

# Go to each folder and install dependencies
cd backend
yarn

cd ../frontend
yarn

cd ../mobile
yarn
```

Now you will need two opened terminals to run the project. One for the backend and another one for the frontend or mobile.

Backend will run on http://localhost:5000/

Frontend will run on http://localhost:3000/

Mobile will run on http://localhost:19002/

```sh
# Go to backend
cd backend

# Run the project
yarn start

## In the another terminal ##

# Go to frontend
cd frontend

# Run the project
yarn start
```

For the mobile web app keep backend running and do the following:

```sh
# Go to mobile
cd mobile

# Run the project
expo start
```

This will start expo CLI on your browser. A QR code will appear on your screen and in terminal. You can scan this QR code with [Expo app](https://expo.io/tools#client) to see the application running in your phone. -->
